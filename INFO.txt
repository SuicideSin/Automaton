This application originated in 2009, back before I had a smartphone. I wanted a
way to interface with a computer through SMS, and I definitely couldn't afford
a dedicated cell phone to receive the messages and relay them to a computer,
so I used the little-known feature of cell phone numbers - you can actually
email them using a carrier-specific domain name. So I set up an email account
and wrote a small application to monitor it for new mail from my phone number,
then execute what was in the body and return the first 160 characters of the
response. That was fun for checking how many email messages I had or doing a
quick translation of a phrase, but it wasn't really as effective as a smart
phone due to the fact that I was only able to poll for new messages every X
minutes (I had not yet discovered the IDLE command). I used that application
for a year until I got a smart phone, then it outlived its usefulness and
disappeared from use.
