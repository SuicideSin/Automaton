Automaton

Introduction
============

This program was built to aid in automating tasks and enabling a "smart home".
It began as a single python file that would emulate the effects of a smart phone
through text messages and it grew as I wanted an easy way to add both scripts
and frontends to interface with those scripts.

It is implemented as a client-server architecture using the Apache Thrift
http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/ RPC project. This allows the server to be written
in a single language and allow easy access to the scripts from many other
languages and remote computers.

Requirements
============

Apache Thrift: Currently information about installing can be found on Thrift's
webpage http://incubator.apache.org/thrift. If it moves out of incubator status,
a quick Google search should find it.

Python: The server is written in Python. Originally compiled with Python 2.6.5 but
I am unaware of features specific to any one Python version.

Linux-like operating system? While Thrift may be installed on Windows, I've never
tried it. Also, scripts that access a specific path may cause trouble. Nothing
confirmed, though.

Installation
============

Install Apache Thrift to both the machine the server will be located on and any
machines that will house clients.

Navigate to the Automaton directory and build the thrift-python bindings with
thrift --gen py automaton_thrift.thrift

...setup.py?
